## Lessons & Reflections
- Maintaining a synchronized Memory Bank is essential for proper project tracking
- Transforming from general e-commerce to tech-focused platform requires careful planning
- Tech e-commerce sites have different information architecture than general retail
- Server equipment categories need specialized UI components
- Business model pivot to direct configuration lead generation required careful UI planning
- PDF generation capabilities need to be simulated in development but require libraries in production
- Email systems need proper validation and user feedback
- Next.js App Router provides a powerful structure for organizing tech e-commerce pages
- Tailwind CSS significantly speeds up UI development with consistent styling
- Removing authentication simplifies the user journey and development requirements
- Focusing on lead generation over account management aligns with B2B sales processes
- Responsive design needs to be considered from the beginning
- Docker setup simplifies development environment configuration but requires careful management
- MongoDB seeding is essential for realistic product catalog development
- Container persistence through volume mounting is critical for development workflow
- Environment variables need careful management across different containers
- Docker networking configuration is critical for multi-container applications
- Admin interfaces should be completely separated from customer-facing pages
- Bulk import functionality is essential for efficient product management
- CSV and JSON formats provide flexible options for data import
