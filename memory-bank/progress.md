## Lessons & Reflections
- Maintaining a synchronized Memory Bank is essential for proper project tracking
- Transforming from general e-commerce to tech-focused platform requires careful planning
- Tech e-commerce sites have different information architecture than general retail
- Server equipment categories need specialized UI components
- Business model pivot from direct checkout to PDF/email lead generation required careful UI planning
- PDF generation capabilities need to be simulated in development but require libraries in production
- Email forms need proper validation and user feedback
- Next.js App Router provides a powerful structure for organizing tech e-commerce pages
- Tailwind CSS significantly speeds up UI development with consistent styling
- Mock data structure helps decouple frontend and backend development
- Responsive design needs to be considered from the beginning
- Docker setup simplifies development environment configuration
- TypeScript improves code quality and maintainability
