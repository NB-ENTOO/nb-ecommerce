### Current Findings
- Website follows a clean, professional e-commerce layout focused on B2B customers
- Strong emphasis on product categorization and detailed specifications
- Responsive design implementation with mobile-friendly navigation
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities for technical products
- Detailed product pages with comprehensive specifications
- Multi-step checkout process with quote request option

### Memory Bank Implementation
- Created and organized all core memory bank files
- Established .cursorrules file in project root
- Set up tasks.md as single source of truth for task tracking
- Implemented memory bank protocol following Level 4 (Complex System) workflow
- Will use creative phases for complex design decisions
- Documentation structure now follows memory bank protocol

### Next Steps
1. Finalize analysis of interactive elements and responsive behavior
2. Complete component library planning
3. Finalize technology stack decisions
4. Design database schema for products and categories
5. Plan API endpoints for e-commerce functionality
6. Create Docker configuration for development environment

## Lessons & Reflections
- Comprehensive documentation is essential for complex e-commerce replication
- Breaking down the site into core components helps manage implementation complexity
- Memory bank protocol provides effective structure for documentation
- Need to carefully plan component hierarchy to match the original site's approach
- Will require creative phases for complex components like mega-menu and filtering system
