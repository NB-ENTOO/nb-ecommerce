- Maintaining a synchronized Memory Bank is essential for proper project tracking
- Transforming from general e-commerce to tech-focused platform requires careful planning
- Tech e-commerce sites have different information architecture than general retail
- Server equipment categories need specialized UI components
- Business model pivot to direct configuration lead generation required careful UI planning
- PDF generation capabilities need to be simulated in development but require libraries in production
- Email systems need proper validation and user feedback
- Next.js App Router provides a powerful structure for organizing tech e-commerce pages
- Tailwind CSS significantly speeds up UI development with consistent styling
- Removing authentication simplifies the user journey and development requirements
- Focusing on lead generation over account management aligns with B2B sales processes
