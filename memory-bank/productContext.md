2. **Responsive Design**: Creating a seamless user experience across various device sizes
3. **Modern Architecture**: Implementing a scalable, maintainable codebase using contemporary web technologies
4. **Local Deployment**: Setting up a containerized environment using Docker for consistent development and testing

## Target Audience

- Web designers studying effective e-commerce UI/UX 
- DevOps practitioners working with containerized web applications

## Success Metrics
- Visual and functional fidelity to the original website
- Responsive behavior matching or exceeding the original
