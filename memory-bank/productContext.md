# E-commerce Website Replication - Product Context

## Project Purpose
This project focuses on creating a server and IT equipment e-commerce platform that showcases enterprise-grade hardware solutions. The primary goal is to create a lead generation platform for server and network equipment sales, where potential customers can:

1. Browse detailed server and networking equipment options
2. Configure custom server solutions based on their needs
3. Generate PDF specifications of their configurations
4. Submit inquiries via email form with their configuration details

The project replicates the visual style and functionality of the ETB Tech website while adapting it to our NET-BRIDGE branding, with a focus on presenting server and networking equipment in a professional, tech-focused environment.
