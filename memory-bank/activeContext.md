- Configure proper environment variable management

## Recent Decisions
- Prioritized database seeding over further frontend enhancements
- Decided to focus on containerization stability before new features
- Opted for MongoDB seeding scripts over manual data entry
- Selected Docker Compose for orchestrating the development environment
- Decided to implement volume mounting for development data persistence
- Chose to implement environment-specific configuration files
- Determined need for admin panel to manage product data
- Selected secure admin-only authentication for product management
- Decided to implement CSV/JSON bulk import functionality

## Next Implementation Steps
- Create MongoDB seed data scripts for server products
- Debug Docker container networking issues
- Implement proper volume mounting for development
- Develop admin panel with secure authentication
- Create product management interface
- Implement product upload functionality
- Add bulk import capability for products
- Set up container health checks
- Create docker-compose configuration for production
- Implement database backup strategy
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for container deployment
- Test multi-container communication

## Notes
- Database seed data should include realistic server specifications
- Docker containers need reliable networking configuration
- Volume mounting required for database persistence during development
- Environment variables must be properly configured for containers
- Container builds should be optimized for production deployment
- Database seeding is essential for realistic product catalog
- Docker containerization needs to be stable before deployment
- Development focus has shifted to infrastructure and data management
- Continuous integration workflow needs to be established
- Container orchestration is critical for stable deployment
- Admin panel requires secure authentication separate from customer-facing features
- Product management interface should support individual and bulk operations
- CSV and JSON import formats should be supported for bulk uploads
- Product data validation critical for maintaining data integrity
