# E-commerce Website Replication - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implement authentication system for admin access.
- Connect NextAuth.js frontend to backend JWT authentication.
- Implement role-based authorization for protected admin routes.
- Create database seeding scripts/data for server products.
- Optimize Docker containerization (networking, volumes).

## Current Focus
- Implementing authentication system for the admin panel
- Continuing development of admin panel features
- Setting up database seeding for realistic server product data
- Debugging and optimizing Docker containerization
- Ensuring stable development environment across team members
- Preparing for production deployment

## Recent Changes & Activity
- Completed refactoring of `frontend/components/products/ConfigurationBuilder.tsx`:
  - Implemented `useReducer` for state management.
  - Aligned component logic strictly with `IProduct` type definition from `frontend/types/product.ts`.
  - Corrected type errors resulting from initial refactoring assumptions.
  - Removed unsupported features (build time, warranty/support upgrades) based on `IProduct` type.
- Performed minor code cleanup in `ConfigurationBuilder.tsx` (removed unused imports/comments).
- Migrated data fetching in `ProductsPage` (`frontend/app/products/page.tsx`) to React Server Components.
- Refactored `ProductFilter` (`frontend/components/products/ProductFilter.tsx`) to manage its own state and update URL.

## Recent Activities
- Implemented admin dashboard with statistics and recent activity display
- Created product management page with listing, filtering, and action buttons
- Developed product edit form with comprehensive fields for all product details
- Added product creation functionality with "New Product" page
- Created category management page with hierarchical display
- Implemented product import page for bulk data uploads
- Fixed Docker configuration issues for development environment
- Updated NextAuth implementation to work correctly with Next.js App Router
- Modified frontend Docker container to use development mode for better debugging
- Fixed backend typings by adding required type declarations
- Resolved port conflicts in Docker configuration
- Updated NextAuth.js configuration to connect with backend JWT authentication
- Created admin login page with error handling and form validation
- Implemented protected middleware for admin routes with role-based authorization
- Set up AuthProvider for session management across the application

## Current Challenges
- Connecting frontend authentication with backend JWT system
- Implementing proper role-based authorization for admin routes
- Creating login/register pages that work with the backend
- Adding authentication to protected routes in the admin dashboard
- Creating realistic seed data for server products
- Ensuring consistent Docker container behavior
- Managing data persistence between container restarts
- Configuring proper volume mounts for development
- Ensuring MongoDB connection stability in containerized environment
- Synchronizing frontend and backend container communication
- Maintaining compatibility with Windows 10 (10.0.19045) development environment

## Short-term Goals
- Implement authentication system with JWT integration
- Connect admin login to backend authentication
- Create comprehensive seed data for server products and components
- Debug and optimize Docker container setup
- Implement Docker volume persistence for development
- Optimize container communication
- Implement secure admin authentication
- Set up CI/CD for container deployment
- Implement database backup strategy
- Configure proper environment variable management

## Recent Decisions
- Used development mode in frontend Docker container to avoid build issues
- Changed frontend container port to 3001 to avoid port conflicts
- Added missing type declarations to backend for JWT and bcrypt
- Implemented AdminLayout component for consistent admin UI
- Used modular approach for admin components to improve maintainability
- Decided to next focus on authentication system implementation
- Prioritized connecting frontend auth with backend JWT

## Next Implementation Steps
- Implement authentication system with JWT integration
- Create login and registration pages for admin access
- Connect frontend auth with backend JWT system
- Add authentication middleware to protect admin routes
- Create MongoDB seed data scripts for server products
- Debug Docker container networking issues
- Implement proper volume mounting for development
- Set up container health checks
- Create docker-compose configuration for production
- Implement database backup strategy
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for container deployment
- Test multi-container communication

## Notes
- Admin panel now has basic structure with dashboard, products, and categories pages
- Product management interface includes listing, editing, and creation features
- Category management supports hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
- Import functionality allows for CSV/JSON uploads with validation
- Docker configuration is functioning but could be optimized further
- Authentication system needs to be properly connected between frontend and backend
- Database seed data should include realistic server specifications
- Docker containers need reliable networking configuration
- Volume mounting required for database persistence during development
- Environment variables must be properly configured for containers
- Container builds should be optimized for production deployment
- Admin panel requires secure authentication separate from customer-facing features
- Product management interface should support individual and bulk operations
- CSV and JSON import formats should be supported for bulk uploads
- Product data validation critical for maintaining data integrity
- Development is being done on Windows 10 (10.0.19045) environment
