The admin panel is structured as a separate section within the Next.js application, using a dedicated layout and navigation system specifically for administrative functions. It follows a modular pattern with consistent UI components and hierarchical organization.

### Admin Route Structure
```
/admin                     # Dashboard home
/admin/products            # Product management
/admin/products/[id]       # Product editing
/admin/products/new        # Create new product
/admin/products/import     # Bulk import
/admin/categories          # Category management
/admin/categories/[id]     # Category editing
/admin/users               # User management (planned)
/admin/settings            # System settings (planned)
```
