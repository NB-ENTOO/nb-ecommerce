# E-commerce Website - System Patterns

## Implemented Architecture

The e-commerce website follows a modern web application architecture with these implemented components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Next.js        │     │  Express        │     │    MongoDB      │
│  Frontend       │◄────┤     Backend     │◄────┤                 │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Implemented Technical Patterns

### Frontend Architecture
- Next.js 13+ App Router for page organization and routing
- Component-based UI architecture with React functional components
- Responsive design implementation using Tailwind CSS
- React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
- Layout component pattern for consistent page structure
- Mock data for development and testing

### Backend Architecture
- RESTful API design with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling and access
- Controller-based architecture for request handling
- Route organization by resource type
- Environment-based configuration with dotenv

### Database Design
- Mongoose schemas for data modeling
- Product model with comprehensive fields for e-commerce
- Timestamped documents for tracking creation and updates
- Validation rules embedded in schemas

### Containerization Strategy
- Docker-based development environment with docker-compose
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, and MongoDB
- Volume mapping for code sync during development
- Environment variable management for configuration

### Component Library
- Layout components (Navbar, Footer, Layout)
- Page-specific components organized by feature
- Lucide React for consistent icon system
- Tailwind CSS for styling with utility classes
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

## Implementation Guidelines (Applied)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Component reusability across pages
- State management with React hooks
- Form handling with controlled components
- Multi-step processes with state transitions
- Clean separation between UI and business logic
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

## Page Structure
- **Layout**: Common structure with Navbar and Footer
- **Home**: Hero section, featured categories, featured products
- **Products**: Filtering sidebar, product grid, sorting options
- **Product Detail**: Image, info, specs, related products
- **Cart**: Line items, quantity controls, order summary
- **Checkout**: Multi-step process (shipping, payment, review)
- **Profile**: Account info, order history with tabs

## Data Flow Patterns
- API requests for data fetching
- Form state management for user input
- Local state for UI interactions
- Conditional rendering based on state
- Mock data for development and testing
- Error handling for API failures

## State Management Approach
- React hooks for component-level state
- useState for simple state management
- useEffect for side effects and data fetching
- Props for component communication
- Form state for user input
- Local component state for UI interactions
